## Quick start

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:bulb:
**Tip:**
If you just want to see all available commands quickly, jump straight to the <a href="#command-summary">Command summary</a> table.
</div>

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed on your computer.<br>

   <div class="alert alert-primary" markdown="1">
   :bulb: **Tip:** To check your version, open a command terminal and run:

   ```bash
   java -version
   ```
   </div>

   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W14-1/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your EduBook.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar edubook.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing `help` and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all students.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com c/Class 1-A` : Adds a student named `John Doe` to EduBook.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd student shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all students.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items enclosed in curly braces with a vertical bar (e.g. `{A | B}`) indicate that **exactly one of the options must be supplied**.<br>
  e.g. `{n/NAME | c/CLASS}` can be used as `n/John Doe` or as `c/Class 1-A`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE`, `p/PHONE n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Applying a label: `label`

The label command lets you assign a single label to a specific student or to all students in a class, depending on your input.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:bulb: **Tip:**
Labels help you keep track of specific information about students, such as 'Top Student' or 'Always Late', making it
easier to organise and identify your students!
</div>

* If `n/NAME` is used:
    * Applies the label `LABEL` to the student named `NAME`.
    * The student must exist in EduBook.
    * The student must not have a current label.


* If `c/CLASS` is used:
    * Applies the label `LABEL` to every student in the specified class `CLASS`.

### Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from EduBook.

Format: `clear`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">
:exclamation: **Caution:**  
The `clear` command will permanently remove all student data. This action cannot be undone.
</div>

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

### Saving the data

EduBook data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

EduBook data is saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/edubook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

Please ensure that formatting rules are followed during manual editing.   
See [Formatting rules for inputs](#formatting-rules-for-inputs) above.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:pushpin: **Note:**
If your changes to the data file make its format invalid, EduBook will display an error message as shown below.

To retain your saved file, exit immediately without making changes to the blank file. Revert the changes and reload EduBook. 
Otherwise, a new empty file will be used. The new file **will be saved** upon using the `exit` command or making changes to the file, 
**erasing the old file**.

</div>


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">
:exclamation: **Caution:**
Certain edits can cause the EduBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range).  
Only edit the data file if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>


### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous EduBook home folder. <br>

**Q**: How do I restore to full view after doing `view`? <br>
**A**: Use the `list` command to restore full view. <br>

**Q**: How do I restore my data if I accidentally used `clear`? <br>
**A**: Unfortunately, there is no command to undo the `clear` command. 
We recommend saving a backup file as a precaution to prevent future incidents.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
